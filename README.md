Both notebooks work separately, as they are intended for different sets of data (.csv files for clinical data and MRI images in .nii format).
All files are extracted from OASIS (Open Access Series of Imaging Studies, https://www.oasis-brains.org/), specifically from the OASIS-3 dataset, through the Xnat API.
